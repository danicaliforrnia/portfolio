# 🚀 The "Hire Me or You'll Regret It" Portfolio

Welcome to the digital residence of **Daniel Stefanelli**, a Senior Software Engineer who spends more time chasing 100%
test coverage than he does chasing his dreams (actually, they are the same thing).

This isn't just a portfolio; it's a high-performance, over-engineered, React-powered masterpiece that probably has more
unit tests than your favorite production app.

## 🌈 The "I Definitely Didn't Just Pick Random Colors" Palette

We spent several minutes (maybe even ten!) meticulously selecting these colors to ensure maximum professional vibes and
eye-pleasing aesthetic:

- **Primary (#2119B7)**: A blue so deep it knows your secrets.
- **Secondary (#080860)**: Darker than my coffee at 3 AM.
- **Accent (#ED3A5B)**: To remind you that I have a personality.
- **White (#FFFFFF)**: Because we believe in light mode (sometimes).
- **Black (#000000)**: Like the soul of a bug that refuses to be reproduced.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (The "Buzzword Bingo" Edition)

- **Next.js 16**: Because being on the edge isn't enough; we need to be on the *cutting* edge.
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: For when v3 just felt too "2024".
- **shadcn/ui**: Copy-pasting components like a professional senior engineer.
- **Vitest**: Because we need to know if our `1 + 1` still equals `2` with 97.18% certainty.
- **Lucide React**: For icons that look better than my handwriting.

## 🧪 Testing (The Overachiever Section)

We reached **97.18% test coverage**. Why? Because we could. We even tested the "Copy Email to Clipboard" feature,
because we're terrified of the 2.82% chance that you might actually have to type an email address manually.

Run the tests yourself and watch the green bars:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

Warning: Viewing this much green may cause sudden urges to refactor everything.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone it**: `git clone ...` (You know the drill).
2. **Install things**: `npm install`.
3. **Run it**: `npm run dev`.
4. **Be amazed**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and witness greatness.
